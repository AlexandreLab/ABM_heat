1,Carbon price assumptions are the same for all scenarios.               ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"Industry and Services - This is the traded carbon price under the EU emissions trading scheme, which began in 2005. Historical prices reflect prices of European allowances traded on the Intercontinental Exchange.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Projections result from BEIS modelling (see https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/carbon-valuation--2). These figures have been developed for internal BEIS modelling purposes and should not be considered official BEIS “forecasts” of future carbon prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"Electricity supply sector - For gas and coal plants, the total carbon price is given by the sum of BEIS's EU-ETS interim carbon price projections (Oct 2019) and the rate of Carbon Price Support (CPS). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Carbon Price Support rates in this report reflect the CPS rate cap of £18/tCO2 in 2020/21 and in 2021/22, consistent with the announcement made at Budget 2016 and reiterated at Budget 2018. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"From 2021/22 until 2040 (the final year projected in EEP), we assume that the total carbon price for the electricity sector is maintained at the 2021/22 level (uplifted by RPI minus CPI). If the price of the EU ETS rises above this (this does not happen for EEP2019), the carbon price for the electricity sector coincides with the EU ETS price instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,The Green Book Supplementary Guidance (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/valuation-of-energy-use-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions-for-appraisal) should be used for valuing energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions. To note there is a difference in the retail prices published ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,in Annex M and the HMT Green Book Supplementary Guidance Appraisal Guidance as some of the cost components are estimated in different ways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Conversion to constant prices uses the GDP deflator series provided above (in annual growth form). See note 2 above on Annual growth rates for economic parameters for price conversion methodology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"Projected retail prices are an outcome of the modelling process. They are based on projected wholesale prices (for the relevant scenario) and on averaged historical non-fuel costs. They are uplifted by taxes, fuel duties and policy cost recovery including any announced future changes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Hence they will be dependent on the policies included in the scenario.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,Aviation fuel prices are no longer reported as they are no longer direct assumptions in modelling for the Energy and Emissions Projections. The Department for Transport provide projections of aviation fuel demand to BEIS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,Residential prices include VAT. This is at the standard rate (currently 20%) for transport fuels and a reduced rate (5%) for heating fuels. Industry and services prices do not include VAT. Oil prices include petroleum duties. Other non-residential fuels include the climate change levy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Industrial prices allow for the average impact of Climate Change Agreement (CCA) rebates and Good Quality Combined Heat and Power (GQCHP) exemptions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,We base energy units for gas and petroleum products on gross calorific values (GCV) also known as higher heating values (HHVs).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"We align historical retail natural gas and electricity retail prices in the industrial and services sectors to ""Quarterly Energy Prices: Prices of fuels purchased by non-domestic consumers in the United Kingdom"" (Table 3.4.1).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"""Transport: road (Private Vehicles)""  is a weighted average of electricity retail prices in the domestic and services sectors using assumptions provided by the Office for Low Emission Vehicles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"""Average of road transport fuels"" is a weighted average for private vehicles including a contribution from electric and plug-in hybrid cars. The weights reflect the fuel use mix in each year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
